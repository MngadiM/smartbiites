Overview
The Meal Suggestion App is an Android application that helps users choose a meal based on different categories such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and desserts. The app displays a list of meals from each category and allows users to receive a random meal suggestion when they press the "Surprise Me" button. This app provides a simple and fun way to decide what to eat throughout the day.

Features
Meal Categories: The app has predefined meal categories including:

Breakfast

Lunch

Dinner

Snacks

Desserts

Meal Display: Each category button, when clicked, displays a list of meals specific to that category with descriptions.

Surprise Me Feature: The app offers a "Surprise Me" button, which randomly selects a meal from all categories and displays it to the user.

Edge-to-Edge Design: The app supports edge-to-edge display to make full use of the screen real estate, giving it a modern and clean look.

Requirements
Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher

Kotlin programming language

Android Studio for building and running the app

Code Overview
MainActivity.kt
The main activity of the app contains the UI elements, meal categories, and logic for displaying meals.

Key Components:
UI Elements:

mealTextView: A TextView to display the meal description.

mealImageView: An ImageView (currently unused in this snippet but could be used for meal images).

Buttons for each meal category: breakfastButton, lunchButton, dinnerButton, snacksButton, dessertsButton, and surpriseMeButton.

Meal Data:

The meals are stored in predefined lists such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and desserts.

Button Click Listeners:

Each category button has a click listener that triggers the displayMenu() function, which displays the relevant meals.

The "Surprise Me" button triggers the surpriseMe() function, which selects a random meal from all categories and displays it.

Methods:
displayMenu(menu: List<String>): This method takes a list of meals as input, concatenates them into a string, and displays them in the mealTextView.

surpriseMe(): This method selects a random meal from all available meal categories and displays it in the mealTextView.

Layout
The layout activity_main.xml (not shown in the code snippet) should contain:

A TextView for displaying meal information.

An ImageView for showing images (optional).

Buttons for each meal category and a surprise button.

How to Use
Launch the app on your Android device or emulator.

Choose a category by clicking one of the category buttons (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, Desserts).

The list of meals for that category will be displayed in the mealTextView.

Optionally, click the "Surprise Me" button to get a random meal suggestion from any category.

Future Improvements
Images for Meals: Add meal images to accompany the descriptions.

Custom Meal Input: Allow users to add their own meals to the categories.

Meal Preferences: Add functionality to save user preferences for certain types of meals.
